Introduction
There are several major CAD modeling softwares (SolidWorks, Inventor, Onshape, Creo, ANSYS, Solid Edge). Learning how to use any of them well requires lessons and hands-on practice. While most programs have built-in well-formatted, basic tutorials, instructors often need to create custom tutorials to teach their students more effectively. Most often, these tutorials are produced in the form of lengthy PDF files with several screenshots and page breaks.
This website is a tool for instructors to easily create and post clear, well-formatted CAD tutorials for students to follow. Users can sign up as instructors or students and maintain profiles on the website. Instructors can add and edit step-by-step tutorials with tool icons. Students can view tutorials and search for tutorials on the website.
Core Features
Home Page: Explains purpose of website and directs users to sign up as instructor or student.
Lessons Page: Allow users to view a list of all tutorials on the website.
Search Lessons: Allow users to search or filter the list of tutorials for a particular tutorial or set of tutorials.
View Lesson Page: Allow students to view a tutorial.
Add/Edit Lesson Page: Allow instructors to create step-by-step tutorials for CAD projects.
Pre-loaded CAD tool icons: Allow instructors to easily add icon references to tools in their tutorials to assist students in finding them while following the lesson.
Many CAD tools are shown by icons with no name visible. It’s helpful for beginner students to be reminded that the “mirror feature” tool is .
User Profile Page: Allow users to set a name and view the tutorials they’ve created.

Extra Features
Allow students to ask questions on a lesson that are sent to the instructor for further explanation.
Save student activity so they can return to lessons they viewed recently.
Basic classroom system that allows instructors to assign lessons to a set of students.
Allow instructors to create quizzes or projects that students can interactively learn from.
Allow instructors to tag their lessons with identifiers such as the CAD program and version used, skill level (beginner, intermediate, advanced), and topic application (robotics, 3D printing, automotive, etc)
Allow instructors to link their own premade part files for use in assembly tutorials.
Keyword pop-ups that remind students how to zoom in/out (usually scroll wheel), pan the current view (varies by program), reorient to standard view (varies by program), etc.
